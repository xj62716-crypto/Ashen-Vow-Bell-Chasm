# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Game-time control (freeze / step / thaw / status)
#
# Real-time games race ahead of high-latency agents: 10-40s of consequences
# land between every observation and the action it informs. These primitives
# make game time answer to the agent's clock instead: freeze the tree, think
# arbitrarily long (all observation tools work while frozen — rendering
# continues during pause), then step forward a bounded slice of game time
# with inputs riding inside the window.
#
# tree.paused is a single bit that two parties now write: the game's own
# pause menu and this freeze. The bridge layers them — effective state is
# (game_paused OR frozen) — by observing and re-asserting: it cannot
# intercept writes, but it processes every frame (PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS, and
# as an autoload it runs BEFORE the scene), so a game-code flip is caught on
# the next frame, recorded as the game layer's new intent, and overridden
# while frozen. step/thaw restore the game's wish, not whatever we found.
#
# What freeze means: exactly what runs during the game's own pause menu runs
# during freeze (WHEN_PAUSED/ALWAYS nodes, process_always timers). A game
# with a correct pause menu has already partitioned pause-immune from
# pausable code; freeze rides that contract. Games that "pause" by writing
# Engine.time_scale = 0 instead are frozen solid too, but their pause is
# invisible to the layer model (it looks like gameplay state, not pause
# state) — documented limitation.
