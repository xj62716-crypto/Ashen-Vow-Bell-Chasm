## Cross-language wire-contract check for the watch lifecycle (#286).
##
## The watch contract (request/response/event/sample key names) lives as literals
## on BOTH sides of the bridge: the GDScript sampler PRODUCES the response keys,
## the TypeScript server CONSUMES them. Before this test, each side asserted only
## its own literals, so a rename on either side passed both suites green. This
## suite pins the PRODUCER side against a shared artifact
## (res://addons/godot_mcp/test/watch_contract.json); the server vitest
## (watch-contract.test.ts) pins the CONSUMER side against the SAME file. A rename
## now breaks its own suite.
##
## KNOWN BOUNDARY: the editor command layer's request-key consume
## (runtime_state_commands.gd) and the editor->game positional decode are
## GDScript<->GDScript and not on this suite's runtime path — the request-key
## NAMES are pinned on the TS send side instead. This suite pins the high-value
## cross-language surface: the watch_collect response keys, the per-event/sample
## dict keys, and the watch_start response keys the sampler owns.
##
##   & "<godot.exe>" --headless --path "<project-with-addon>" \
##       --script "res://addons/godot_mcp/test/watch_contract_headless_test.gd"
## Exit code 0 = all checks passed, 1 = at least one failed.
